We can optimize the Hamming loss by simply predicting each individual component $y_i$ independently since the loss is a linear combination of losses on each individual component $i$. For a specific $i$ this again corresponds to minimizing the 0/1 loss.

\begin{align}
	y^* &= \underset{y \in \mathcal{Y}}{\operatorname{argmin}} \sum_k \frac{1}{n} \sum_i I(y_i \neq C_i^k) p(C^k|x) \\
	y_i^* &= \underset{y_i}{\operatorname{argmin}} \sum_k I(y_i \neq C_i^k) p(C_i^k|x) \\
	&= \underset{C_i^k}{\operatorname{argmax}} ~ p(C_i^k|x)
\end{align}

The normal 0/1 loss optimizes the joint probability of the complete state, whereas the Hamming loss optimizes the probability of each variable individually. For two pixels we could have the following probabilities:

\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c}
	x/y & 0   & 1    \\ \hline
	0	& 0.4 & 0.15  \\ \hline
	1	& 0   & 0.3    \\ 
\end{tabular}\\

In this case the 0/1 loss would predict $x=0$ and $y=0$ and the Hamming loss $x = 0$ and $y=1$.
