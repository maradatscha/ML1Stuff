\section*{Multi-Class Classification} 
For our one-vs-rest SVM we get an error of: 258 of 9000
using RBF with $\gamma = 8738.427$\\
For our one-vs-one SVM we get an error of: 362 of 9000
using RBF with $\gamma = 8738.427$\\

We tried to implement the true multiclass SVM but due to some unknown circumstances the matlab quadprog did not converge in a reasonable amount of time.
